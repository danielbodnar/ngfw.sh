## Technical Debt

**Priority:** HIGH
**Found by:** Architecture Review Agent

### Issue

Single 1254-line file handles ALL storage operations:

- **Location:** [`packages/api/src/storage/mod.rs`](https://github.com/danielbodnar/ngfw.sh/blob/main/packages/api/src/storage/mod.rs)
- **Domains:** fleet, wan, lan, wifi, dhcp, routing, firewall, nat, ips, vpn, qos, ddns, dns, traffic, billing, user, reports, logs, onboarding, backup, firmware, system

### Impact

- Unmaintainable
- Most functions return hardcoded stub data
- No separation of concerns
- Testing difficulty

### Recommendation

Decompose into domain-specific storage modules:

```
packages/api/src/storage/
├── fleet.rs
├── network.rs
├── security.rs
├── services.rs
├── system.rs
└── mod.rs (coordination only)
```

### Effort

2-4 days
