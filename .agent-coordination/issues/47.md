## Clippy Warnings — Mostly Fixed

**Priority:** LOW
**Found by:** Rust Clippy Analyzer

### Issue

Originally 39 unused variables in test code. Most have been fixed by prefixing with underscore. **1 confirmed remaining:**

- [`packages/agent/tests/integration_websocket.rs:181`](https://github.com/danielbodnar/ngfw.sh/blob/main/packages/agent/tests/integration_websocket.rs#L181) — `shutdown_rx` should be `_shutdown_rx`

### Solution

```rust
// Line 181: change
let (shutdown_tx, shutdown_rx) = ...
// to
let (shutdown_tx, _shutdown_rx) = ...
```
