Configure your WAN (Wide Area Network) connection to connect your network to the internet.

## Connection Types

NGFW.sh supports three WAN connection types:

### DHCP (Automatic)

Most common for home and small business connections. Your ISP assigns an IP address automatically.

### Static IP

For connections with a fixed IP address provided by your ISP.

### PPPoE

Used by some DSL and fiber providers. Requires username and password.

## Configuration

Navigate to **Network** → **WAN** in the dashboard to configure your connection.

See the [API Reference](/api/overview) for programmatic configuration.
