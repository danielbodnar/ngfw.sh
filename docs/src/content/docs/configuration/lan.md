description: Configure local network and VLANs
---

Configure your LAN (Local Area Network) settings and create VLANs for network segmentation.

## LAN Configuration

The primary LAN interface is typically bridged to include multiple physical ports and wireless interfaces.

## VLANs

VLANs allow you to segment your network for improved security and organization:

- **IoT VLAN** - Isolate smart home devices
- **Guest VLAN** - Separate guest WiFi traffic
- **Cameras VLAN** - Security camera network

See the [API Reference](/api/overview) for programmatic configuration.
