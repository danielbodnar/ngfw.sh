QoS ensures critical traffic gets priority on your network.

## Traffic Classes

Create classes with different priorities:
- Real-time (VoIP, gaming)
- Interactive (web browsing)
- Bulk (downloads, backups)

## Device Limits

Set bandwidth limits for specific devices.

## Application Control

Prioritize or limit traffic by application type.

See the [API Reference](/api/overview) for programmatic configuration.
