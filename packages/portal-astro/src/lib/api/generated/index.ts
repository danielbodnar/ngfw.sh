 * Auto-generated API client and Zod schemas
 *
 * This directory contains TypeScript types and Zod schemas generated from the

 * To regenerate:
 *   - Local:  bun run generate:api    (requires ../api/openapi.json)
 *   - Remote: bun run generate:api:remote (uses https://api.ngfw.sh/openapi.json)
 *
 * Do not edit files in this directory manually - they will be overwritten.

// export * from './client'

// Placeholder export until generation runs
